## Task Mobile App
A mobile app that allows you to save, create, edit, delete, and recover tasks if needed. Tasks can be registered with a description, an alarm time, days when they need to be completed, and you can also track your progress by saving it. Additionally, the app rewards you with motivational images depending on the situation.

### [EN]
#### Technologies
* Python 3.12: Ensures compatibility with the latest features and improvements of the language.
* Kivy: Used to build the graphical user interface (GUI) of the application.
* KivyMD 1.2.0: Provides Material Design components for enhanced visual and functional design.

#### Programming Approach
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Uses OOP principles to structure and organize the code effectively.
* Dictionary Usage: Manages and accesses data efficiently using dictionaries, leveraging O(1) complexity to optimize data access and reduce O(n) complexity.
* List Comprehensions: Concise and readable data manipulation using list comprehensions.
* Mathematical Logic: Applies mathematical logic to solve various functions, improving functionality and performance.

#### Modularization
* Good Modularization Practices: Separates design (frontend) and functionality (backend) into distinct components.
* Module Optimization: Modules are optimized for efficiency, with methods and functions organized in an orderly manner according to their respective files.

#### Flexibility
* Database Adaptability: The core logic for task management can be adapted to work with various database systems, following similar principles for storage, retrieval, and manipulation of tasks.

#### Data Management
* Pickle Module: Used for storing and retrieving data in binary format.
* Soft Delete: Marks tasks as deleted without actually removing them from the list.
* Unique IDs: Uses unique IDs corresponding to indices in the list for proper task management.
* Performance Optimization: Applies efficient data access and manipulation techniques. Uses Big O complexity to optimize performance, leveraging dictionaries for O(1) speed and reducing O(n) complexity.

#### User Interface (UI) Design
* KivyMD and KV Language: Provides a flexible and dynamic interface design.

#### APK Build
* Buildozer: Used to package the application into an APK.
* Google Colab: Used as an environment to run Buildozer and create the APK.

#### Additional Considerations
* Problem Solving: Demonstrated ability to resolve various issues encountered during the application's testing, ensuring its correct and smooth operation.
* Documentation: Complete in English, ensuring accessibility for a broader audience.
* Ongoing Development: The application is still under development and presents opportunities for future expansions and improvements.

#### File Structure
* models/: Contains the models used in the application.
* kv/: Contains Kivy language (KV) files for designing the user interface.
* screens/: Contains the different screens of the application, defining the design and functionality of each page.
* apk/: Buildozer and steps to follow in Google Colab.
* main.py: The main file to run the application.
